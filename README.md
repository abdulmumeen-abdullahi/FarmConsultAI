Agriculture is the backbone of food security, yet millions of farmers—especially in developing regions like Nigeria—struggle with unpredictable weather, crop diseases, and limited access to expert advice. I built FarmConsultAI to tackle these critical challenges by putting the power of AI directly into the hands of farmers.

## 💡 Project Overview

FarmConsultAI is an intelligent, AI-powered web application designed to help farmers, agropreneurs, and agri-investors make smarter, data-driven decisions. It integrates machine learning, computer vision, and generative AI to provide a holistic farm advisory service.

### Key Features

* **📈 Crop Yield Prediction:** A **Random Forest Regressor** model predicts crop yield in tons/hectare based on soil type, weather conditions, and Nitrogen level.
* **🌿 Crop Disease Diagnosis:** An **EfficientNet-B3** computer vision model detects and classifies diseases from uploaded crop leaf images with high accuracy.
* **💬 AI-Powered Advice:** **Google's Gemini** provides actionable recommendations and conversational follow-ups, explaining complex insights in simple, local-friendly language.
* **🖥️ Interactive Web App:** A user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit** makes these powerful tools accessible on any device with an internet connection.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

This project combines multiple AI disciplines into a seamless user experience.

* **Frontend:** `Streamlit`
* **Yield Prediction:** `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`
* **Disease Diagnosis:** `PyTorch`, `TIMM (PyTorch Image Models)`
* **Generative AI & Chat:** `Google Generative AI (Gemini)`
* **Deployment:** `Streamlit Community Cloud`

The application follows a simple, effective architecture:
1.  The **Streamlit UI** captures user inputs (form data for yield, images for diseases).
2.  The inputs are processed and fed into the appropriate backend model (**Random Forest** or **EfficientNet-B3**).
3.  The model's prediction is passed to the **Gemini API** along with a structured prompt.
4.  Gemini generates a detailed, easy-to-understand explanation and actionable advice.
5.  The final output and conversational chat interface are rendered back to the user in the Streamlit app.

## 🎯 Impact & Relevance

FarmConsultAI directly addresses several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
* **SDG 1 (No Poverty):** By improving farm productivity and reducing crop losses.
* **SDG 2 (Zero Hunger):** Helping farmers grow more and waste less to feed communities.
* **SDG 13 (Climate Action):** Promoting climate-smart agriculture through informed decision-making.

In Nigeria, where farmers often lack access to timely agronomic expertise, this app bridges a critical knowledge gap. It democratizes access to AI-driven insights that were once out of reach, empowering a new generation of farmers.
